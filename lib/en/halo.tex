\beginverse \memorize
\[^G]Remember those walls I \[Am]built
Well baby they're tumbling \[Em]down
And they didn't even put up a \[C]fight
They didn't even make a sound\[G]
I found a way to let you \[Am]in
But I never really had a \[Em]doubt
Standing in the light of your \[C]halo
I got my angel \[G]now
It's like I've been awak\[Am]ened
Every rule I had you breakin'\[Em]
It's the risk that I'm takin'\[C]
I ain't never gonna shut you \[G]out
\endverse

Everywhere I'm looking ^now
I'm surrounded by your embr^ace
Baby I can see your halo^
You know you're my saving grace^
You're everything I need ^and more
It's written all over your ^face
Baby I can feel your halo^
Pray it won't fade away^
\endverse

\beginchorus
I can feel your \[G]halo (halo) halo
I can see your \[Am]halo (halo) halo
I can feel your \[Em]halo (halo) halo
I can see your \[C]halo (halo) halo
\[G]Woah...
\endchorus


\beginverse
Hit me like a ray of sun^
Burning through my darkest ^night
You're the only one that I want^
Think I'm addicted to your light^
I swore I'd never fall a^gain
But this don't even feel like ^falling
Gravity can't forget^
To pull me to the ground again^
Feels like I've been aw^akened
Every rule I had you breakin'^
The risk that I'm takin'^
I'm never gonna shut you out^
