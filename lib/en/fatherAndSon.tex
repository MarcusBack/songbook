It's not \[G]time to make a \[D]change, just rel\[C]ax and take it \[Am7]easy
You're still  \[G]young that's your \[Em]fault, there's so \[Am]much you have to \[D]know
Find a  \[G]girl, settle \[D]down, if you \[C]want, you can \[Am7]marry
Look at  \[G]me, I am \[Em]old, but I'm \[Am]happy \[C G D]
I was  \[G]once like you are \[D]now, and I \[C]know that it's not \[Am7]easy
To be  \[G]calm when you've \[Em]found something \[Am]going on \[C G D]
But take your  \[G]time, think a \[D]lot, why think of \[C]everything you've \[Am7]got
For you will \[G]still be here to\[Em]morrow, but your \[D]dreams may \[G]not

\beginverse \newchords{son} \memorize[son]
How can \[G]I try to ex\[Bm]plain? 'cause when I \[C]do he turns aw\[Am7]ay again
It's \[G]always been the \[Em]same, same old \[Am]story \[C G D]
From the \[G]moment I could \[Bm]talk I was \[C]ordered to \[Am7]listen
Now there's a \[G]way, and I \[Em]know that I \[D]have to \[G]go away
I \[D]know I \[C]have to \[G]go

\beginverse \replay[father]
It's not ^time to make a ^change, just sit ^down and take it ^slowly
You're still ^young, that's your ^fault, there's so ^much you have to go ^through
Find a ^girl, settle ^down, if you ^want you can ^marry       
Look at ^me, I am ^old, but I'm ^happy ^
\endverse

%[Verse 4 - Son]
\beginverse \replay[son]
All the ^times that I've cr^ied, keeping ^all the things I ^knew inside
It's ^hard, but it's ^harder to ig^nore it ^
If they were ^right, I'd ^agree, but it's ^them they know, not ^me
Now there's a ^way, and I ^know that I ^have to ^go away
  I ^know I ^have to ^go
