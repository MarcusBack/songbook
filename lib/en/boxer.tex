\beginverse \memorize
\[C]I am just a poor boy 
Though my story's seldom \[Am]told
I have \[G]squandered my resistance
For a \[G7]pocketful of \[G6]mumbles 
Such are \[C]promises      
All lies and \[Am]jest          
Still, a \[G]man hears what he \[F]wants to hear    
And \[C]disregards the \[G]rest \[G7] \[G6] \[C]

When I ^left my home and my family                        
I was no more than a ^boy                                 
In the ^company of strangers                              
In the ^quiet of a railway ^station                       
Running ^scared                                           
Laying ^low, seeking ^out the poorer ^quarters            
Where the ^ragged people ^go                              
Looking for the places ^only ^they would ^know

Asking ^only workman's wages                               
I come looking for a ^job                                  
But I get no ^offers                                       
Just a ^come-on from the ^whores on Seventh ^Avenue        
I do de^clare there were ^times when I was ^so lonesome    
I took some comfort ^there                                
Lie-la-^lie, la-^lie-^la-la-^lie

Then I'm ^laying out my winter clothes                    
And wishing I was ^gone                                   
Going ^home                                               
Where the ^New York City ^winters aren't ^bleeding me     
Leading ^me                                               
Going \[G]home \[G7 G6 C]

In the ^clearing stands a boxer                           
And a fighter by his ^trade                               
And he ^carries the remainders                            
Of ^every glove that ^laid him down                       
And ^cut him till he cried out                            
In his anger and his ^shame                               
“I am ^leaving, I am ^leaving”                            
But the ^fighter still re^mains ^^^
