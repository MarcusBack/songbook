\beginverse \memorize
\[Am]Show me how to lie
you’re getting \[F]better all the time
And turning \[C]all against the one
is an \[G]art that’s hard to teach
\[Am]Another clever word
sets off an \[F]unsuspecting herd
and as you \[C]step back into line
A mob \[G]jumps to their feet
Now \[Am]dance fucker dance
man he \[F]never had a chance
And no \[C]one even knew
it was \[G]really only you
\endverse

\beginverse*
And now you \[F]steal away
take him \[Dm]out today
Nice \[F]work you did
you’re gonna go \[Em]far, kid
\endverse

\beginchorus
With a \[Am]thousand lies and a \[F]good disguise
Hit ‘em \[C]right between the eyes
Hit ‘em \[G]right between the eyes
when you \[Am]walk away,nothing \[F]more to say
See the \[C]lightning in your eyes
See ‘em \[G]running for their lives
\endchorus
  
\beginverse \replay
^Slowly out of line
and drifting ^closer in your sights
So play it ^out I’m wide awake
it’s a ^scene about me
There’s ^something in your way
and now ^someone's gonna pay
And if you ^can’t get what you want
well it’s ^all because of me
Now ^dance fucker dance
man I ^never had a chance
And no ^one even knew
it was ^really only you
\endverse

\beginverse*
And now you’ll \[F]lead the way
show the \[Dm]light of day
Nice \[F]work you did
You’re gonna go \[Em]far, kid
Trust, deceived
\endverse
