\beginverse \memorize
\[G]Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like \[Em]this,
In the firelight Fer\[Am]nando,
You were humming to yourself \brk and softly strumming your \[D]guitar.
I could hear the distant drums,\brk and sounds of bugle calls were coming from \[G]afar.

\endverse

\beginverse \replay
^They were closer now Fernando,
Every hour every minute seemed to last eter^nally.
I was so afraid Fer^nando.                                                        
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to ^die.
And I'm not ashamed to say, \brk The roar of guns and cannons almost made me ^cry.
\endverse

\beginchorus
There was \[Dsus4]something in the \[D]air that night,
The stars were bright, Fer\[G]nando.
They were shining there for \[D]you and me,
For liberty, Fer\[G]nando.
Though I \[G7]never thought that we could \[E]lose,
There's no \[Am]regret.
If I had to do the \[D]same again,
I would, my friend, Fer\[C]nand\[G]o.
\endchorus

\beginverse \replay
^Now we're old and grey Fernando.
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your ^hand.
Can you hear the drums Fer^nando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we 
crossed the Rio ^Grande?
I can see it in your eyes,
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this ^land.
\endverse
