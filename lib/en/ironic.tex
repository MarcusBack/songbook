\beginverse\memorize
An \[D/F#]old \[Gadd9]man \[D/F#]turned ninety-\[Em7]eight
He won the \[D/F#]lotte\[Gadd9]ry and \[D/F#]died the next \[Em7]day
It's a \[D/F#]black \[Gadd9]fly in your \[D/F#]chardo\[Em7]nnay
It's a \[D/F#]death row \[Gadd9]pardon two \[D/F#]minutes too \[Em7]late
Isn't it i\[D/F#]ronic...\[Gadd9] don't you \[D/F#]think\[Em7]
\endverse

\beginchorus\replay
It's like ^ra^in on your ^wedding ^day
It's a free ^r^ide when you've ^already ^paid
It's the good adv^i^ce that you ^just didn't ^take
And \[F]who would've \[Cadd9]thought... it \[D/F#]figures
\endchorus

\beginverse \replay
Mr. ^Play It ^Safe was a^fraid to ^fly
He packed his ^suit^case and kissed his ^kids good-^bye
He waited his ^whole damn ^life to ^take that ^flight
And as the ^plane crashed ^down he thought, well ^isn't this ^nice
And Isn't this i^ronic ... ^don't you ^think? ^
\endverse

\beginverse \replay
A ^traffic ^jam when you're ^already ^late
A no-^smoking ^sign on your ^cigarette ^break
It's like ^10,000 ^spoons when all you ^need is a ^knife
It's ^meeting the man of my ^dreams then meeting his ^beautiful ^wife
And isn't it i^ronic... ^ don't you ^think^
A little too i\[D/F#]ronic.. \[Gadd9] and yeah I \[D/F#]really do \[Em7]think...
\endverse
